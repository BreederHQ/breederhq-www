  // General
  {
    question: 'What is the best software for managing a breeding program?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is comprehensive breeding program management software that combines pedigree tracking with automatic COI calculation, health testing records (OFA, PennHIP, Embark), breeding cycle tracking, 8-phase breeding plan lifecycle management, client portal with e-signatures, waitlist management, invoicing and expense tracking, and an integrated marketplace. Unlike spreadsheets or basic databases, BreederHQ is purpose-built for professional breeders.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What species does BreederHQ support?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ supports professional breeders of dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, and sheep with species-specific tools for each. This includes species-specific breeding cycle timelines, health testing protocols, and genetics tracking appropriate for each species.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best alternative to spreadsheets for breeders?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is the best alternative to spreadsheets for professional breeders. Unlike spreadsheets which scatter data across multiple files with no connections, BreederHQ centralizes everything: pedigrees link to health records, breeding plans connect to waitlists, invoices tie to animals, and all data flows to your marketplace listing. Plus you get automation, reminders, client portals, and genetics tools that spreadsheets cannot provide.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does BreederHQ compare to GoodDog or PuppyFind?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is fundamentally different: instead of just listing animals, breeders manage their entire breeding program on the platform. This creates unprecedented transparency - buyers see actual health testing documentation, pedigrees with COI calculation, breeding history, and program practices from verified program data. Its not just a listing site, its breeding program management software with an integrated marketplace.'
  },
  // Genetics & Health
  {
    question: 'What genetics tools does BreederHQ offer?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ includes advanced genetics tools: multi-locus coat color genetics tracking (E, K, A, B, D, M, S loci for dogs; color genetics for cats and horses), Punnett square analysis for inheritance visualization, offspring genetics simulator using Monte Carlo simulation, best match finder algorithm for optimal breeding partner suggestions with COI penalties and health risk scoring, breeding goal planner for tracking coat/health/physical trait goals, and health genetics with breed-specific test profiles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does BreederHQ track vaccinations and health records?',
    answer: 'Yes, BreederHQ includes comprehensive health tracking: vaccination records with species-specific protocols and expiration alerts, health testing record management (OFA, PennHIP, genetic panels), document attachments per vaccination or test, breed-specific health test profiles, and visibility controls for what buyers can see through the client portal or marketplace.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I store actual documents (PDFs, images)?',
    answer: 'Yes. Attach certificates, lab reports, and exam results directly to the animal\'s record.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it remind me when tests expire?',
    answer: 'Yes. Tests with renewal requirements are tracked and flagged before expiration.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about OFA integration?',
    answer: 'You enter OFA results manually. BreederHQ doesn\'t pull from OFA automatically, but your records can link to OFA for verification.'
  },
  // Pedigrees & COI
  {
    question: 'What pedigree features does BreederHQ offer?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ offers comprehensive pedigree management: multi-generation pedigree visualization with configurable depth, automatic COI (coefficient of inbreeding) calculation with risk levels (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, CRITICAL), common ancestor tracking with contribution percentages, cross-tenant network animal linking via Global Animal ID (GAID) or Exchange Code, and ReactFlow interactive tree visualization. Pedigrees connect to health records and marketplace listings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it calculate coefficient of inbreeding?',
    answer: 'Yes. When planning a breeding, the system calculates COI based on pedigree data with risk levels displayed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many generations can I track?',
    answer: 'As many as you enter. The system doesn\'t limit generation depth.'
  },
  {

    answer: 'Yes. The system identifies and highlights common ancestors when evaluating a potential pairing.'
  },
  // Breeding Cycles & Plans
  {
    question: 'How does BreederHQ track breeding cycles?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ offers comprehensive breeding cycle tracking with species-specific timelines. Features include heat cycle tracking with Full vs Likely windows for conservative planning, hormone testing window calculations, progesterone tracking, breeding plans with 8-phase lifecycle (Planning, Committed, Bred, Birthed, Weaned, Placement Started, Placement Completed, Complete), Gantt chart timeline views, and breeding calendar with scheduling.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my female has irregular cycles?',
    answer: 'The system tracks her actual pattern, irregular or not. Predictions improve as more data is recorded.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I track split heats or silent heats?',
    answer: 'Yes. Unusual cycles can be noted and recorded as exceptions.'

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I see all planned breedings on a calendar?',
    answer: 'Yes. The breeding calendar shows expected heats, planned breedings, and whelping dates together.'
  },
