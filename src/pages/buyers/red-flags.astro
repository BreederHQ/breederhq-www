    question: 'What if a breeder has one red flag but everything else seems good?',
    answer: 'Depends on the red flag. Some are dealbreakers (no health testing, won\'t let you visit). Others deserve conversation. Ask about the concern directly and evaluate the answer.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are all breeders who advertise online problematic?',
    answer: 'No. Many responsible breeders advertise online. But how and where they advertise matters. Breed club websites and specialized platforms are more trustworthy than general classified sites like Craigslist.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I can\'t afford a dog from a responsible breeder?',
    answer: 'Consider adoption from rescue organizations or breed-specific rescues. Many wonderful animals need homes. What you shouldn\'t do is buy from problematic breeders—the long-term costs in health issues often exceed the initial savings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it okay to report suspected puppy mills?',
    answer: 'Yes. If you see animal welfare concerns, reporting to appropriate authorities helps protect animals and prevents others from unknowingly supporting those operations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if the breeder seems offended by my questions?',
    answer: 'Good breeders welcome thorough questions—it shows you\'re serious. If a breeder is offended by standard questions about health testing, visits, or practices, that\'s itself a red flag.'

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Red flags include no health testing, unwillingness to let you visit, always having puppies available, multiple breeds, meeting in parking lots, no questions asked about you, prices that seem too good to be true, and defensive or evasive answers. These warning signs help you avoid puppy mills, backyard breeders, and scams.

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Not all breeders operate ethically. Some prioritize profit over animal welfare. Others mean well but lack knowledge. This guide helps you identify warning signs before you commit money or emotion to the wrong situation.

  <!-- Section 3: Critical Red Flags -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Critical red flags (walk away immediately)</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Won't let you visit</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            If a breeder refuses to let you see where animals are kept, there's a reason. Legitimate concerns about biosecurity don't prevent visits—they just mean you follow protocols. Meeting in parking lots or suggesting they'll deliver without you seeing the facility first is a major warning sign.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Exception:</strong> Video calls during pandemic restrictions or if you're very far away—but that should lead to an eventual in-person visit before pickup.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No health testing documentation</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            "My vet says they're healthy" is not health testing. Genetic testing for breed-specific conditions is standard practice for responsible breeders. If they can't or won't provide documentation of health tests on both parents, walk away.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Exception:</strong> None. This is non-negotiable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Puppies or kittens always available</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Responsible breeders don't operate like retail stores. If they always have animals available immediately, they're breeding too frequently or keeping unsold animals for too long. Both indicate problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Multiple breeds available</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Selling multiple breeds (especially many different breeds) suggests a commercial operation focused on profit, not breed improvement. Responsible breeders typically focus on one breed, occasionally two related breeds.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Exception:</strong> Separate hobby breeders sharing a website or property—but each should specialize in their own breed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Won't take animals back</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Responsible breeders commit to their animals for life. If they're not willing to take an animal back if you can't keep it, they don't care where their animals end up. This should be in the contract.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Doesn't ask you questions</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            If a breeder will sell to anyone with money and doesn't screen buyers, they don't care about placement quality. Good breeders are selective about homes.

  <!-- Section 4: Price Red Flags -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Price red flags</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Significantly cheaper than market rate</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Health testing costs money. Proper veterinary care costs money. Quality food costs money. Early socialization takes time. If a price seems too good to be true, corners were cut somewhere. Ask where.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>What to do:</strong> Research average prices for your breed from responsible breeders. Prices 30-50% below market rate deserve skepticism.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Extremely high prices without justification</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            High prices don't automatically mean quality. Ask what justifies the price. Legitimate answers include extensive health testing, titled parents, proven bloodlines, or specialized programs. Vague answers about "premium" quality or "rare" colors are warning signs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Variable pricing based on appearance</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Charging more for "rare" colors, especially colors outside breed standards or associated with health problems (like merle-to-merle breeding), indicates profit-driven breeding, not ethical practices.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Some price variation for breeding vs. pet quality is normal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Payment methods</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Requests for payment via wire transfer, cryptocurrency, or untraceable methods can indicate scams. Legitimate breeders typically accept checks, bank transfers, or payment platforms with buyer protection.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Communication red flags</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Defensive or evasive answers</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Good breeders welcome questions. If a breeder gets defensive when asked about health testing, visiting, or breeding practices, that defensiveness tells you something.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Pressure to commit quickly</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "Someone else is interested, you need to decide now" is a sales tactic. Responsible breeders want you to be sure. They'll give you time to think.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Poor communication</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Slow responses happen. Life happens. But consistent poor communication—not answering questions, vague responses, changing stories—suggests disorganization or dishonesty.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No online presence or poor website</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Not all good breeders have fancy websites, but responsible breeders should have some verifiable presence—website, social media, breed club membership, references. No online footprint makes verification difficult.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Inconsistent information</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If details keep changing (price, availability, parent information, health testing), that inconsistency is a warning sign of disorganization or dishonesty.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Can't meet the mother</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You should always meet the mother. She lives there. If the breeder won't show her or makes excuses why she's not available, question why. The father may be off-site (common with stud services), but the mother should be present.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Too many dogs or litters at once</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Large-scale operations with many breeding animals and multiple litters simultaneously suggest commercial breeding, not a small hobby program focused on quality.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Puppies or kittens leaving too young</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Animals should stay with their mother and littermates until at least 8 weeks old (12 weeks for many toy breeds and kittens). Breeders who let them go earlier are prioritizing turnover over proper development.

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Before you've committed</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Walk away. It's okay to say no. "I've decided to keep looking" is a complete sentence. Don't let emotion or pressure override caution.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">If you've already put down a deposit</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Most deposits are non-refundable, but if you've discovered serious concerns (health/safety issues, dishonesty, illegal activity), document everything and consider walking away anyway. Better to lose a deposit than commit to years with a sick animal or support unethical practices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">If you suspect illegal activity</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Animal cruelty, fraud, or unsafe conditions should be reported to local animal control, state agricultural departments, or law enforcement. Document what you've seen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Trust your instincts</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If something feels wrong, it probably is. Don't rationalize away concerns. The right breeder will still be there when you're ready, or there will be another litter.

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
        When a breeder uses professional management software like BreederHQ, it's often a sign of a more organized, transparent operation. They can quickly show you health records, pedigrees, and breeding history because that information is organized and accessible. Not all great breeders use software, but many responsible breeders do—it helps them maintain the detailed records and documentation that buyers should expect.

          <p>No. Many responsible breeders advertise online. But how and where they advertise matters. Breed club websites and specialized platforms are more trustworthy than general classified sites like Craigslist.</p>
