    question: 'What makes dog breeding software different from general pet software?',
    answer: 'Dog breeding software needs to understand canine reproduction: heat cycles, progesterone timing, 63-day gestation, OFA/PennHIP tracking, COI calculation, and litter management. Generic pet software doesn\'t have these breeding-specific features.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can dog breeding software calculate COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding)?',
    answer: 'Good dog breeding software should calculate COI from pedigree data and help you evaluate breeding decisions before you make them. BreederHQ calculates COI automatically from your pedigree records.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does progesterone test tracking work?',
    answer: 'Dog breeding software should let you enter multiple progesterone tests per cycle, calculate optimal breeding timing, and predict ovulation based on the data. This is essential for timing breedings correctly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I track OFA and health testing results?',
    answer: 'Yes. Dog breeding software should track OFA numbers, PennHIP scores, genetic test results, and clearances. These should link to individual dogs and display on pedigrees so you can see health testing at a glance.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it work for multiple dog breeds?',
    answer: 'Yes. BreederHQ works for one breed or multiple breeds. Different breeds have different health testing requirements and characteristics, and the software accommodates breed-specific needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does litter management work in dog breeding software?',
    answer: 'Each puppy should be an individual record (not just a count) where you can track weights, colors, markings, and link each puppy to a buyer. Good software treats litters as collections of individual puppies.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can buyers access their puppy information?',
    answer: 'Yes. BreederHQ includes buyer portals where clients can see their puppy\'s information, pedigree, photos, and documents. This saves you countless hours answering repetitive questions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it handle AI (artificial insemination) breedings?',
    answer: 'Yes. Dog breeding software should handle documentation and timing for frozen semen, fresh chilled, and surgical AI—all common methods in dog breeding.'
  }

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Good dog breeding software needs OFA/PennHIP tracking, COI calculation, progesterone test timing, and understanding of canine reproductive cycles. Avoid generic pet software or systems that don't distinguish between seasonal and year-round cycling breeds. Always test with your actual breeding program data.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Dog breeding has specific requirements. Your software needs to understand canine reproduction, breed-specific health testing, and registry requirements. This page explains what to look for—whether you choose BreederHQ or another platform.

  <!-- What to Look For -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">What to look for in dog breeding software</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">OFA and PennHIP integration</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Health testing is non-negotiable in responsible dog breeding. Your software should track OFA numbers, PennHIP scores, genetic test results, and clearances. It should link these to individual dogs and show them on pedigrees.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">COI calculation</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Coefficient of Inbreeding matters. The software should calculate COI from pedigree data and help you evaluate breeding decisions before you make them. If it can't do this, you're calculating manually or ignoring it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Progesterone test tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Timing is everything in dog breeding. The software should track progesterone levels, predict optimal breeding windows, and help you plan AI or natural breedings based on actual data.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Heat cycle management</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Every breed is different. Some cycle every 6 months, some every 12. Your software should track individual patterns, predict future cycles, and alert you when bitches are due.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Breed-specific health tests</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Golden Retrievers need different tests than German Shepherds. The software should understand breed-specific requirements and let you track what matters for your breed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">AKC and UKC registry support</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Registration numbers, titles, and DNA profiles matter. Your software should track these and generate the information you need for litter registrations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Litter management</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            From whelping through placement. Track individual puppies, weights, colors, markings. Link puppies to buyers. Generate documentation. If the software treats a litter as one record instead of individual puppies, it's not built for breeding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Waitlist and buyer management</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Good breeders have waitlists. Your software should help you manage them—track preferences, match puppies to buyers, and handle the communication that comes with every litter.

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Red flags in dog breeding software</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Generic pet management systems</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Software built for pet daycares or veterinary clinics is not breeding software. If it doesn't understand heat cycles, progesterone timing, and litter management, it won't work for breeding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No distinction between breeding types</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Dogs cycle differently than cats or horses. Software that treats all species the same doesn't understand canine reproduction. If it can't handle seasonal vs. year-round cycling, it's not for dogs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Manual pedigree entry without import</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Entering 5-generation pedigrees manually is a waste of time. Good software imports from registries or pedigree databases. If you're typing everything, the software is working against you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No health test tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you can't track OFA numbers, genetic tests, and clearances in the system, you're keeping separate records. That defeats the purpose of breeding software.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Limited to one breed</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Some breeders work with multiple breeds. If the software locks you to one breed or charges per breed, that's a problem if you expand.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No genetic calculations</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            COI, color genetics, trait predictions—these matter. Software that only stores data without calculating anything isn't helping you make better breeding decisions.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Questions to ask any dog breeding software vendor</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How does it track progesterone tests?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Can you enter multiple tests per cycle? Does it calculate optimal breeding timing? Does it predict ovulation based on the data? If not, you're still using spreadsheets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Does it calculate COI?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            How many generations? Can you see COI before the breeding happens? If it only shows COI after puppies are born, that's too late.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How are health tests stored?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Can you track OFA numbers, test results, and clearances? Do they show on pedigrees? Can you filter breeding stock by health clearances? This is essential for responsible breeding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How does litter management work?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Are puppies individual records or just a count? Can you track weights, colors, markings? Can you link each puppy to a buyer? The answer matters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Does it understand seasonal vs. year-round cycling?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Some breeds cycle every 6 months like clockwork. Others are irregular. Can the software track and predict both patterns?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Can buyers access information directly?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A buyer portal where clients can see their puppy's information, pedigree, and photos saves you countless hours answering questions. If it doesn't have this, you're still manually managing every request.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">What about AI breedings?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Frozen semen, fresh chilled, surgical AI—these are common in dog breeding. Does the software handle the documentation and timing for different AI methods?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">How does it handle co-ownership?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Many dogs have multiple owners or breeding rights arrangements. Can the software track these relationships and permissions?

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. Test with your actual breeding program</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Enter your dogs. Enter a breeding. Track a heat cycle. See if the workflow makes sense for how you actually work.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. Check breed-specific features</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Different breeds have different requirements. Make sure the software can handle the health tests and characteristics specific to your breed.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">3. Try the buyer-facing features</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If the software has buyer portals or client-facing tools, test them. This is where you'll save the most time once you have a litter on the ground.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">4. Ask other breeders in your breed</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            What do successful breeders in your breed use? Their experience matters. But also test yourself—what works for them might not work for you.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Dog breeding software needs to understand canine reproduction. Heat cycles, progesterone timing, health testing, COI calculation—these aren't optional features.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Generic pet software won't work. Neither will livestock software or systems built for other species. You need software built specifically for dog breeding.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
        Use free trials. Test with your actual data. Choose software that makes your work easier, not harder.
