        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Good breeding software understands your species, connects all records, helps you plan (not just record history), works on mobile, and has active development. Avoid ancient interfaces, desktop-only systems, and "we do everything" platforms. Always use free trials with your actual data before committing.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        There are many options for breeding software. Some are good. Some are not. This page explains what to look for and what to avoid—whether you choose BreederHQ or something else.

  <!-- What to Look For -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">What actually matters in breeding software</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Species-appropriate design</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Software built for dogs shouldn't be used for horses. Software built for pets shouldn't be used for breeding. The system needs to understand breeding biology—cycles, gestation, litter management—for your species.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Connected records</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your animal records, breeding records, client records, and financial records should be connected. If you have to cross-reference between systems or manually copy data, you're doing work the software should do.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Actual breeding tools</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Not just a database with a "breeding" label. Cycle tracking. Date calculations. Breeding calendars. Litter management. Genetics tracking. If the software doesn't help you plan and manage breedings, it's not breeding software.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Client management</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Breeding is a relationship business. Your software should help you manage those relationships—waitlists, communication, contracts, documents.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Buyer-facing tools</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Modern buyers expect more than emails and text messages. A buyer portal, documentation sharing, and professional presentation matter.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Mobile access</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You're not always at your desk. The software should work on your phone when you're in the barn, at a show, or meeting a buyer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Sustainable company</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Software that hasn't been updated in years won't be around in five more. Look for active development and responsive support.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Software that claims to handle dogs, cats, horses, livestock, exotics, and also be a general farm management tool probably does none of them well.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Ancient interfaces</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If the software looks like it was built in 2005 and hasn't been updated since, expect a frustrating experience.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No trial period</h3>

  <!-- What Makes Good Breeding Software -->
  <section class="py-20 px-4 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Questions to ask any breeding software</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Does it understand my species?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Ask about cycle tracking, gestation calculations, and species-specific features. If they treat all animals the same, it's not breeding software—it's a database.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Are records connected or separate?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Can you click from an animal to its breeding to the litter to the buyer to the invoice? Or do you have to search separately in different areas?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Does it help me plan or just record history?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Breeding software should predict cycles, calculate dates, and show you what's coming. If it only records what already happened, it's not helping you breed better.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Can my buyers access information directly?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A buyer portal saves you hours of answering the same questions. If the software doesn't have this, you're still manually managing buyer communication.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Does it work on my phone?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You need access when you're not at your desk. Mobile-responsive web apps or dedicated mobile apps are essential.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">When was it last updated?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Active development means bugs get fixed, features get added, and the company is invested in the product's future.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Can I try it first?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A free trial lets you test with your actual data. If they won't offer one, that's a red flag.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">What happens to my data if I leave?</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You should be able to export your data. If it's trapped in their system, you don't really own it.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">How to make your decision</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. Know what you actually need</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Don't pay for features you won't use. But don't choose software that can't grow with you either. Think about where you'll be in 2-3 years.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. Try multiple options</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Most good software offers free trials. Use them. Enter your actual data. Try your actual workflows. See what feels right.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">3. Test support before you commit</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Ask a question. See how fast they respond and whether they understand breeding. Support matters more than features when something goes wrong.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">4. Calculate the real cost</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Monthly fees are obvious. But what about your time? If software saves you 5 hours a month, that has value. Factor that in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">5. Trust your gut</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If the software feels confusing or frustrating during a trial, it won't get better later. You need something you'll actually use.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Good breeding software should make your life easier, not harder. It should understand your species. It should connect your records. It should help you plan, not just record history.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Whether you choose BreederHQ or something else, choose software that's actively maintained, offers good support, and fits how you actually work.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
        And always use the free trial. Your data will tell you if the software is right.
