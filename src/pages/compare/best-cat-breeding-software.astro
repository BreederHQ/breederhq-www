    question: 'What makes cat breeding software different from dog breeding software?',
    answer: 'Cats are induced ovulators—ovulation happens after mating, not on a cycle. Cat breeding software must understand this fundamental difference, plus blood type compatibility (to prevent neonatal isoerythrolysis), and feline-specific health concerns like HCM, PKD, and PRA.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is blood type tracking critical in cat breeding software?',
    answer: 'Neonatal isoerythrolysis kills kittens when blood types are incompatible. Cat breeding software should track blood types for all breeding cats and warn you about incompatible pairings before you breed. This is life-or-death for kittens.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does induced ovulation tracking work?',
    answer: 'Cat breeding software must calculate due dates differently than dog software because ovulation happens after breeding, not before. The software needs to account for this when calculating gestation and due dates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I track HCM, PKD, and PRA screening?',
    answer: 'Yes. Cat breeding software should track heart disease (HCM), kidney disease (PKD), and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) test results. These should link to individual cats and display on pedigrees.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it handle color genetics for cats?',
    answer: 'Yes. Cat color genetics are complex (silver, smoke, points, dilutes). Good cat breeding software tracks genetic markers and helps predict color outcomes for breeding planning.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can it track multiple matings?',
    answer: 'Yes. Cat breeders often breed queens multiple times over 2-3 days to ensure pregnancy. The software should track each mating separately and calculate dates from the first successful breeding.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it work with TICA and CFA registries?',
    answer: 'Yes. BreederHQ tracks registration numbers, titles, and show records for TICA, CFA, and other registries. It generates the information you need for litter registrations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will dog breeding software work for cats?',
    answer: 'No. Dog breeding software that assumes spontaneous ovulation (like dogs) will calculate dates incorrectly for cats. You need software specifically built to understand feline reproduction.'
  }

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Good cat breeding software needs induced ovulation tracking, blood type compatibility checking, HCM/PKD/PRA screening records, and understanding of queen cycling patterns. Avoid dog-focused software that doesn't understand feline reproduction. Always test with your actual cattery data.

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">What to look for in cat breeding software</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Induced ovulation tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cats don't ovulate on a schedule like dogs. They're induced ovulators—ovulation happens after mating. Your software needs to understand this and track breeding timing differently than it would for dogs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Blood type compatibility</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Neonatal isoerythrolysis kills kittens. Your software should track blood types for all breeding cats and warn you about incompatible pairings before you breed. If it doesn't do this, you're risking kitten lives.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">HCM, PKD, and PRA screening</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Heart disease, kidney disease, and progressive retinal atrophy are critical in many breeds. Track test results, link them to individual cats, and show them on pedigrees. Responsible breeding requires this.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Queen cycling patterns</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Queens can cycle frequently during breeding season or year-round depending on breed and environment. Your software should track individual patterns and predict when queens will come into heat.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Multiple mating tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cat breeders often do multiple matings over several days to ensure pregnancy. The software should track each mating separately and calculate dates from the first successful breeding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Color genetics</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cat color genetics are complex. Silver, smoke, points, dilutes—breeding for specific colors requires tracking genetic markers and predicting outcomes. Your software should help with this.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">TICA and CFA registry support</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Registration numbers, titles, and show records matter. Your software should track these and generate the information you need for litter registrations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Litter management</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Track individual kittens from birth through placement. Weights, colors, patterns, markings. Link kittens to buyers. Generate documentation. If the software treats a litter as one record, it's not built for breeding.

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Dog-focused breeding software</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Software built for dogs doesn't understand induced ovulation, blood type incompatibility, or feline reproductive patterns. If it treats cats like small dogs, it will work against you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No blood type tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            This is critical in cat breeding. If the software doesn't track blood types and warn about incompatible pairings, you're managing this risk manually. That's unacceptable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Assumes spontaneous ovulation</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cat breeding software that assumes ovulation happens on a cycle (like dogs) doesn't understand feline reproduction. The date calculations will be wrong.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No color genetics support</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Cat color inheritance is complex and breed-specific. If the software can't track genetic markers or help predict color outcomes, you're missing a key breeding tool.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Limited health test tracking</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            HCM, PKD, PRA, FeLV, FIV—these tests are essential. If you can't track results and link them to cats and pedigrees, you're keeping separate records. That defeats the purpose.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No distinction between breeds</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Persian health concerns differ from Bengal concerns. Maine Coon breeding is different from Siamese. If the software treats all cats the same, it's not breed-aware.
