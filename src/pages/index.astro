  {
    question: 'What is the best software for managing a breeding program?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is comprehensive breeding program management software that combines pedigree tracking with automatic COI calculation, health testing records (OFA, PennHIP, Embark), breeding cycle tracking, 8-phase breeding plan lifecycle management, client portal with e-signatures, waitlist management, invoicing and expense tracking, and an integrated marketplace. Unlike spreadsheets or basic databases, BreederHQ is purpose-built for professional breeders.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What genetics tools does BreederHQ offer?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ includes advanced genetics tools: multi-locus coat color genetics tracking (E, K, A, B, D, M, S loci for dogs; color genetics for cats and horses), Punnett square analysis for inheritance visualization, offspring genetics simulator using Monte Carlo simulation, best match finder algorithm for optimal breeding partner suggestions with COI penalties and health risk scoring, breeding goal planner for tracking coat/health/physical trait goals, and health genetics with breed-specific test profiles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does BreederHQ have a client portal for buyers?',
    answer: 'Yes, BreederHQ provides a comprehensive client portal where buyers get 24/7 access to: a dashboard with action items and recent activity, photo galleries of their animal, financial transparency (invoices, payments, Pay Now via Stripe integration), e-signature agreements with status tracking, direct messaging with the breeder via real-time WebSocket updates, and categorized documents (health records, pedigree, contracts, photos).'
  },
  {
    question: 'What species does BreederHQ support?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ supports professional breeders of dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, and sheep with species-specific tools for each. This includes species-specific breeding cycle timelines, health testing protocols, and genetics tracking appropriate for each species.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does BreederHQ track breeding cycles?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ offers comprehensive breeding cycle tracking with species-specific timelines. Features include heat cycle tracking with Full vs Likely windows for conservative planning, hormone testing window calculations, progesterone tracking, breeding plans with 8-phase lifecycle (Planning, Committed, Bred, Birthed, Weaned, Placement Started, Placement Completed, Complete), Gantt chart timeline views, and breeding calendar with scheduling.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What business tools does BreederHQ include?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ includes complete business management: invoicing with line items (deposits, fees, goods, discounts, tax), payment recording (Cash, Check, Credit Card, ACH, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle), expense tracking across 12 categories (Vet, Supplies, Food, Grooming, Breeding, Facility, Marketing, Labor, Insurance, Registration, Travel), financial dashboard with MTD metrics, breeding plan financial rollups with revenue analysis, and CSV export.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does BreederHQ help with waitlist management?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ provides comprehensive waitlist management: buyer applications and intake forms, waitlist position tracking with automated notifications, family-to-animal matching tools, deposit tracking tied to waitlist positions, client portal access for buyers to see their position and receive updates, and communication templates for efficient buyer communication.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What verification badges can breeders earn?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ offers trust badges that are earned, not bought: Verified Breeder (identity and program documentation confirmed), Health Testing (health testing documentation on file), Quick Responder (responds to inquiries within 4 hours during business hours - auto-earned based on actual response times), and Experienced Breeder (5+ successful placements completed - auto-earned).'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best alternative to spreadsheets for breeders?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is the best alternative to spreadsheets for professional breeders. Unlike spreadsheets which scatter data across multiple files with no connections, BreederHQ centralizes everything: pedigrees link to health records, breeding plans connect to waitlists, invoices tie to animals, and all data flows to your marketplace listing. Plus you get automation, reminders, client portals, and genetics tools that spreadsheets cannot provide.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does BreederHQ have a marketplace for selling animals?',
    answer: 'Yes, BreederHQ includes an integrated marketplace where your breeding program data automatically creates verified listings. Features include breeder profiles with discovery filters (species, breed, location), verification badges, animal program listings (Stud Services, Guardian, Trained, Rehome, Co-Ownership), offspring group (litter) listings, individual animal listings, and a buyer dashboard with saved listings, inquiries, and waitlist positions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can BreederHQ track show titles and competition results?',
    answer: 'Yes, BreederHQ includes a titles and achievements system supporting Conformation, Obedience, Agility, Field, Herding, Tracking, Rally, Producing, and Performance categories. Track competition results for Shows, Trials, Races, and Tests with status tracking (In Progress, Earned, Verified), points/major wins, document verification, and producing records showing offspring counts and champion tracking.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What pedigree features does BreederHQ offer?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ offers comprehensive pedigree management: multi-generation pedigree visualization with configurable depth, automatic COI (coefficient of inbreeding) calculation with risk levels (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, CRITICAL), common ancestor tracking with contribution percentages, cross-tenant network animal linking via Global Animal ID (GAID) or Exchange Code, and ReactFlow interactive tree visualization. Pedigrees connect to health records and marketplace listings.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does BreederHQ compare to GoodDog or PuppyFind?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ is fundamentally different: instead of just listing animals, breeders manage their entire breeding program on the platform. This creates unprecedented transparency - buyers see actual health testing documentation, pedigrees with COI calculation, breeding history, and program practices from verified program data. Its not just a listing site, its breeding program management software with an integrated marketplace.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does BreederHQ track vaccinations and health records?',
    answer: 'Yes, BreederHQ includes comprehensive health tracking: vaccination records with species-specific protocols and expiration alerts, health testing record management (OFA, PennHIP, genetic panels), document attachments per vaccination or test, breed-specific health test profiles, and visibility controls for what buyers can see through the client portal or marketplace.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What communication tools does BreederHQ provide?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ includes powerful communication tools: Communications Hub (unified inbox) combining email and direct messages with WebSocket real-time updates, email and message templates with variable insertion (contact name, animal name, etc.), document bundles for quick email attachment, business hours configuration with Quick Responder badge tracking, and coming soon: auto-replies with instant acknowledgment and FAQ responses.'

      <h3>Why BreederHQ vs Alternatives</h3>
      <p>
        Looking for the best dog breeder software? BreederHQ is the best alternative to spreadsheets, GoodDog, PuppyFind, and legacy breeding software. Unlike simple listing sites where breeders self-report information, BreederHQ is complete breeding program management software with an integrated marketplace. Your breeding program data automatically creates your verified marketplace listing. This means buyers see actual health testing documentation (OFA hip/elbow scores, PennHIP results, Embark genetic panels, breed-specific health clearances), real pedigrees with COI calculation, complete breeding history, and verified practices. Find reputable dog breeders, cat breeders, horse breeders, goat breeders, rabbit breeders, and sheep breeders who cannot fake a complete breeding program with documented health testing, pedigrees, and transparent breeding history. For breeders, BreederHQ replaces scattered spreadsheets with centralized data, automates manual processes like cycle tracking and buyer updates, and provides a professional client experience with portal access, e-signatures, and Stripe payments.
