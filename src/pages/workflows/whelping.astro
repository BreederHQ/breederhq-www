        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Whelping generates mountains of data: birth weights, daily weights, milestones, vet visits, puppy identification. Professional systems track everything per litter, flag concerning patterns, and connect puppy records to buyer placements. Paper charts fail when you're managing multiple litters.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Whelping is intense. You're monitoring the dam, tracking individual puppies, documenting weights, watching for problems. Good record-keeping during whelping makes everything else easier. This page explains how professional breeders manage whelping without drowning in paperwork.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Why whelping records matter</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Poor whelping records create problems:
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="mr-3">•</span>

          <span class="mr-3">•</span>
          <span>Weight trends are invisible without daily tracking</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="mr-3">•</span>
          <span>Vet asks about birth weight and you're digging through papers</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="mr-3">•</span>
          <span>Buyers ask questions about their puppy's early days and you have no record</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="mr-3">•</span>
          <span>You lose track of deworming schedules and vaccination dates</span>

        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="mr-3">•</span>
          <span>Critical information is on scraps of paper you can't find</span>

      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Whelping is too important to track on sticky notes. Proper systems keep everything organized when you're sleep-deprived and stressed.

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Common whelping tracking methods</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Whelping charts on paper</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Printed charts taped to the whelping box. Write weights daily in pencil. Good for the moment. Terrible for long-term records or sharing with buyers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Spreadsheets</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A sheet per litter. Columns for each puppy. Rows for each day. Data entry after weighing. It works until your laptop isn't near the whelping box. Or until you need to see the chart on your phone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Notebooks</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Write everything down. Birth times, weights, notes. Finding specific information later means flipping through pages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Photos with timestamps</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Take a photo of the scale. Works for documentation. Terrible for calculating weight gain or spotting trends.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Memory</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "The blue collar puppy was smallest." "I think she weighed about 12 ounces at birth." Memory fails when you're exhausted and managing eight puppies.

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Why whelping tracking fails</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Daily weights become overwhelming</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Eight puppies. Twice daily weighing. That's 16 data points per day. Over eight weeks, that's nearly 900 weights. Paper charts and spreadsheets can't handle this volume efficiently.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Trends are invisible</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Is that puppy gaining appropriately? A list of weights doesn't tell you. You need to see the pattern. Calculating percentage gain manually is tedious.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Puppy identification gets confused</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Colored collars work until they fall off or puppies look similar. Your paper chart says "red collar" but which puppy is that now? Photos help, but organizing them is another task.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Records don't connect to placement</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You've tracked the blue collar puppy from birth. Now he's going to a buyer. Do your whelping records automatically become part of his permanent record? Or are they stuck in a notebook?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Milestones and tasks are forgotten</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Deworming schedule. First vaccination. Microchipping. ENS protocol. These are date-driven tasks. If they're not tracked with reminders, they're easy to miss.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Sharing with buyers is manual</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Buyer wants to know their puppy's birth weight and growth pattern. You're scanning paper charts or copying data from spreadsheets. Professional, this is not.
