  {
    question: 'What are rearing protocols?',
    answer: 'Rearing protocols are structured developmental programs for puppies and other young animals. They include exercises, socialization activities, and handling routines designed to produce well-adjusted, confident animals. Examples include Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS), Early Scent Introduction (ESI), and the Rule of 7s.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What benchmark protocols are included?',
    answer: 'BreederHQ includes industry-standard protocols like ENS (Early Neurological Stimulation/Bio-Sensor Program), ESI (Early Scent Introduction), Rule of 7s, Puppy Culture exercises, and Avidog protocols. Each comes with day-by-day tasks, timing guidelines, and completion tracking.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I create my own custom protocols?',
    answer: 'Yes. The Protocol Builder lets you create custom protocols with your own phases, tasks, and timing. You can start from scratch or modify existing protocols to match your program\'s approach.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does per-puppy tracking work?',
    answer: 'Each puppy in a litter gets individual progress tracking. You can mark tasks complete for the whole litter at once (batch completion) or track exceptions for individual puppies who missed or couldn\'t complete specific exercises.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is community protocol sharing?',
    answer: 'Experienced breeders can share their custom protocols with the community. Other breeders can browse, rate, review, and import protocols that work well. It\'s a way to learn from breeders who have refined their approach over years.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do completion certificates work?',
    answer: 'When a puppy completes a protocol, you can generate a digital certificate documenting their developmental program. Certificates include a verification code buyers can use to confirm authenticity. Great for demonstrating the care that went into raising each puppy.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to use protocols to use BreederHQ?',
    answer: 'No. Protocols are optional. Many breeders start without them and add protocols later as their program matures. The rest of BreederHQ works independently of the protocol system.'

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Rearing protocols like ENS, ESI, and Rule of 7s produce better-adjusted puppies. BreederHQ includes industry-standard protocols built-in, lets you create custom protocols, tracks completion per-puppy with exception handling, enables community protocol sharing with ratings and reviews, and generates verification certificates for buyers. Stop tracking development on paper. Start proving the care you put into every puppy.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The best breeders don't just produce puppies—they develop them. Structured protocols like Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS) and Early Scent Introduction (ESI) create puppies that are more resilient, confident, and adaptable.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        But tracking these programs on paper or in spreadsheets? That's a mess. BreederHQ makes protocol tracking as professional as the protocols themselves.
