        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The BreederHQ Marketplace connects responsible breeders with educated buyers. Verification badges are earned through documented health testing—not self-reported claims. Buyers trust what they see because it's backed by real data. Your reputation is visible, verifiable, and valuable.

        Quality breeders struggle to stand out online. Puppy mills dominate search results. Backyard breeders undercut prices. Serious buyers can't tell the difference. The BreederHQ Marketplace changes that.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You build a website, write about your program, post photos. But SEO is competitive. Your site ranks page 10 while questionable breeders dominate page 1.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Generic listing sites</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Sites like PuppyFind, NextDayPets, or Craigslist. Anyone can list. No verification. Your quality program sits next to puppy mill ads.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Social media</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Facebook groups, Instagram. Good for community, but algorithms limit reach. Building an audience takes years of consistent content.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Breed club referrals</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Registry referral lists. Trusted but limited reach. Most buyers don't know to look there.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Word of mouth</h3>

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Why these approaches struggle</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">No way to prove quality</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Everyone claims "health tested." Everyone says "raised with love." Buyers have no way to verify. So they don't believe anyone—including you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Good breeders look the same as bad ones</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            On generic listing sites, a responsible breeder's ad looks identical to a puppy mill's. Maybe worse, because mills invest in professional photos and copywriting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Price becomes the differentiator</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When buyers can't evaluate quality, they shop on price. Your $2,500 puppy with full health testing loses to the $800 "no papers" option.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Wrong buyers waste your time</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Inquiries from people who want a puppy tomorrow, don't want to fill out an application, can't afford your price. You spend hours responding to leads that go nowhere.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Reputation isn't portable</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your Facebook reviews don't show up on your website. Your OFA results aren't visible on listing sites. Your reputation is scattered and unverifiable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Marketing takes time you don't have</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You're busy with actual breeding work. Social media management, SEO optimization, content creation—these are full-time jobs you can't afford.
