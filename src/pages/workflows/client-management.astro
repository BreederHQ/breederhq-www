        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">TL;DR</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Client management requires tracking communication history, contracts, payments, and ongoing relationships with buyers. Scattered emails and text messages fail. A proper system keeps all buyer information organized with a visual sales pipeline, lead scoring, and analytics—so you know exactly where every buyer stands and who needs attention.

      </aside>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Your reputation depends on client relationships. Poor communication, lost contracts, forgotten follow-ups—these destroy trust. This page explains how professional breeders manage clients without drowning in disorganized messages.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Common client management approaches</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Email and text messages</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            All communication scattered across platforms. Finding what someone told you six months ago means searching through hundreds of messages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Spreadsheets</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Client list with phone numbers and email addresses. Maybe payment status. No communication history. No document storage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Physical folders</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A folder per client with contracts and paperwork. Good for documents. Terrible for tracking communication or accessing information when you're not home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Generic CRM software</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Business CRM designed for sales, not breeding programs. It doesn't understand litters, waitlists, or the specific workflows breeders need.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Memory</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "I remember talking to them about that." Memory fails when you're managing dozens of client relationships over months or years.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Communication history is scattered</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Email, text, Facebook Messenger, phone calls. Every conversation lives somewhere different. When a buyer asks a follow-up question, you're guessing what you already told them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Contracts are hard to find</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Signed contract is in email. Or maybe a scan is on your desktop. Or in a physical folder. When you need to reference contract terms, you're hunting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Payment tracking is manual</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Who paid a deposit? Who paid in full? What payment method did they use? This information lives in your bank records, email, or nowhere. Reconciling payments is painful.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Follow-ups are forgotten</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You meant to check in at six months. You meant to ask for photos at one year. You meant to remind them about annual vet visits. Without a system, follow-ups don't happen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Buyer information requests are repetitive</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "Can you send me his pedigree again?" "What was his birth weight?" "Do you have his vaccination records?" You've sent this information before. You're sending it again because it's not in one accessible place.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Relationships don't scale</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Managing five clients with email and memory? Possible. Managing fifty? Chaos. Your program grows but your client management doesn't.
