# BreederHQ - Professional Breeding Program Management Software
# https://breederhq.com

> BreederHQ is the all-in-one breeding program management platform for professional animal breeders. It replaces spreadsheets with genetics-powered intelligence, automated breeding cycle tracking, client portals, and an integrated marketplace where verified breeders get discovered by serious buyers.

## What BreederHQ Does

BreederHQ is complete breeding software—not just a listing site. Breeders manage their entire operation in one platform:

- **Genetics Analysis**: Automatic COI (coefficient of inbreeding) calculation, offspring genetics simulation using Monte Carlo methods, best-match breeding partner recommendations, Punnett square analysis, multi-generation pedigree visualization
- **Breeding Cycle Management**: Species-specific heat cycle tracking with Full vs Likely windows, progesterone timing, pregnancy milestones, whelping/foaling date predictions, breeding calendar
- **Health Record Management**: Vaccination tracking with expiration alerts, health testing documentation (OFA, PennHIP, Embark, genetic panels), breed-specific test profiles
- **Client Portal**: 24/7 buyer access with Stripe payments, e-signature contracts, document sharing, direct messaging, waitlist position visibility
- **Business Tools**: Invoicing, expense tracking, financial dashboards, deposit management, CSV export
- **Marketplace Integration**: Breeding program data automatically creates verified marketplace listings
