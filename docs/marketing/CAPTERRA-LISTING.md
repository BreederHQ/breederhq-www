## Product Name
BreederHQ

## One-Line Description (max 100 characters)
Breeding program management software with genetics tools and integrated marketplace

## Overview/About

BreederHQ is professional breeding program management software designed for serious animal breeders. Unlike spreadsheets or basic databases, BreederHQ connects all your breeding data: pedigrees link to health tests, breeding plans connect to waitlists, and your program data automatically creates verified marketplace listings.

Built for professional breeders of dogs, cats, horses, goats, rabbits, and sheep, BreederHQ includes genetics-powered intelligence (COI calculation, offspring prediction, best-match finder), species-specific breeding cycle tracking, a professional client portal with payments and e-signatures, and business tools for invoicing and expense management.

**The key difference**: BreederHQ isn't just software OR a marketplace - it's both. Breeders manage their complete programs on the platform, so marketplace listings are backed by actual documented health testing, calculated pedigrees, and verified breeding practices. Buyers see real data, not self-reported claims.

## Key Benefits

1. **Replace Spreadsheets**: Centralize scattered data with connected records - pedigrees, health tests, breeding plans, clients, and finances all linked together

2. **Genetics Intelligence**: Automatic COI calculation, offspring genetics prediction, best-match breeding recommendations, and health risk screening

3. **Professional Client Experience**: Give buyers a portal with payments, contracts, messaging, and documents instead of scattered emails

4. **Get Discovered**: Your breeding program data automatically creates verified marketplace listings that help serious buyers find you

5. **Save Time**: Automate reminders for heat cycles, health test renewals, vaccination schedules, and client follow-ups
