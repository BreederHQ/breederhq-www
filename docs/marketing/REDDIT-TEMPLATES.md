### Template 1: "How do you track breeding records?"

**Search for**: "breeding records", "track litters", "breeding spreadsheet", "pedigree software"

```
Great question! A lot of breeders start with spreadsheets but eventually hit limits:

**What works about spreadsheets:**
- Familiar, free, customizable
- Good for simple tracking of dates and names

**Where spreadsheets break down:**
- Data isn't connected (pedigree in one sheet, health tests in another, no link between them)
- No automatic COI calculation
- Can't share a "client portal" with buyers
- Easy to lose data or have version conflicts
- No reminders for expiring health clearances

**What to look for in software:**
- Does it calculate COI automatically?
- Can you track health testing with documents attached?
- Does it predict heat cycles based on past data?
- Can buyers get a login to see their animal's info?

I've been building breeding software (BreederHQ - disclosure) and the #1 thing breeders tell me is they wish they'd stopped using spreadsheets sooner. But honestly, even if you don't use mine, any dedicated breeding software beats spreadsheets once you have 5+ animals.

What species do you breed? Happy to give more specific suggestions.

### Template 2: "What's the best dog breeding software?"

**Search for**: "breeding software", "kennel software", "best breeding app"

```
Depends on what matters to you. Here's my honest breakdown:

**Free options:**
- Spreadsheets (Google Sheets/Excel) - works but data isn't connected, no COI calculation
- Some kennel club databases - limited features, usually just pedigree storage

**Paid software to evaluate:**
When comparing, ask these questions:
1. Does it calculate coefficient of inbreeding (COI)?
2. Can I track health testing with actual documents attached?
3. Does it have a buyer portal so clients can see their puppy's info?
4. Can it predict heat cycles based on my female's actual pattern?
5. Is the data connected (can I click from pedigree → health tests → breeding plan)?

I built BreederHQ (disclosure: that's my software), so obviously I'm biased. But even if you don't use mine, I'd recommend:
- Get a free trial of 2-3 options
- Enter one of your animals fully (pedigree, health tests, photos)
- See which one feels right

The best software is the one you'll actually use consistently. Happy to answer specific questions about what to look for.

### Template 3: "How do you calculate COI?"

**Search for**: "coefficient of inbreeding", "COI calculation", "inbreeding calculator"

```
COI (coefficient of inbreeding) measures the probability that two alleles at any locus are identical by descent. Higher COI = more inbreeding.

**Quick reference:**
- 0-5%: Low (typical outcross)
- 5-10%: Moderate (some line breeding)
- 10-25%: High (close line breeding)
- 25%+: Very high (half-sibling or closer)

**How it's calculated:**
The formula is: F = Σ[(1/2)^(n1+n2+1) × (1 + FA)]

Where n1 and n2 are the number of generations from sire and dam to common ancestor, and FA is the inbreeding coefficient of that ancestor.

**Practically:**
Most people use software because calculating by hand is tedious once you go beyond 4-5 generations. You need:
1. Complete pedigree data (the more generations, the more accurate)
2. Software that can find all common ancestors
3. The calculation summed across all paths

I work on breeding software (BreederHQ - disclosure) where COI calculation is automatic, but there are also free online calculators if you just need a one-off check. The key is having accurate, complete pedigree data - garbage in, garbage out.

What breed are you working with? Some breeds have higher baseline COI due to small founder populations.

### Template 4: "How do I find a reputable breeder?"

**Search for**: "find reputable breeder", "how to find good breeder", "breeder red flags"

```
Here's what I look for:

**Green flags:**
- Health testing documented (not just "parents are healthy" - actual OFA/PennHIP/genetic panel results)
- Happy to show you test results before you commit
- Asks YOU questions (about your lifestyle, experience, home)
- Has a contract with health guarantees
- Stays in touch after purchase
- Puppies are raised in the home, not a kennel

**Red flags:**
- "Both parents are on site" as the only health claim
- Won't show health test documentation
- Pressures you to decide quickly
- Cash only / no contract
- Multiple breeds available always
- Ships puppies sight unseen

**Where to look:**
- Breed club referrals (AKC parent club for the breed)
- Local breed clubs
- Dog shows (even if you just want a pet)
- Marketplaces that verify breeders (disclosure: I built BreederHQ marketplace which requires actual documented health testing, but there are others too)

The key is: legitimate breeders have nothing to hide. They'll show you health tests, welcome your questions, and care where their puppies go.

What breed are you looking for? Happy to point you to the parent club.

### Template 5: "I'm starting a breeding program, where do I begin?"

**Search for**: "start breeding", "new breeder", "breeding program beginner"

```
Congrats on taking this seriously enough to ask! Here's my honest advice:

**Before breeding:**
1. Find a mentor in your breed - join the breed club, go to shows, build relationships
2. Understand the breed standard and common health issues
3. Complete all recommended health testing for your breed (check the parent club for the list)
4. Have a plan for puppies you can't sell or that come back

**Record keeping (start now, even before breeding):**
- Health test results with documents
- Pedigrees (get as many generations as you can)
- Heat cycle dates and patterns
- Vet records, vaccinations

**Decisions to make:**
- What are your breeding goals? (temperament? conformation? working ability?)
- How will you screen buyers?
- What's your contract/guarantee?
- How will you stay connected with puppy owners?

I build breeding software (BreederHQ - disclosure), so I'm biased toward digital record-keeping. But honestly, even a well-organized binder is better than nothing. The key is being able to look back and see patterns, track health outcomes, and make informed decisions.

The best breeders I know spent 2-3 years learning before their first litter. What breed are you interested in?
```

### Template 6: Response to "spreadsheets work fine for me"

**Only use if someone pushes back on software suggestions**

```
Totally fair! Plenty of successful breeders use spreadsheets. If it's working for you, no reason to change.

The main things that eventually push people toward dedicated software:
- Wanting automatic COI calculation (possible in sheets but complex)
- Giving buyers access to their animal's info (hard to do securely with sheets)
- Reminders for health test renewals (possible with calendar integration)
- Scale - once you're tracking 15+ animals with full pedigrees, spreadsheets get unwieldy

But honestly, a well-maintained spreadsheet beats poorly-used software every time. The best system is the one you'll actually keep updated. 👍
