**Why BreederHQ vs. Alternatives:**

*vs. Spreadsheets:* Connected data (pedigrees link to health tests to breeding plans), automation, reminders, client portal, genetics tools that spreadsheets can't provide.

*vs. GoodDog/PuppyFind:* BreederHQ is actual breeding software, not just a listing site. Marketplace listings are backed by real program data - health testing is documented, pedigrees are calculated, not claimed.

*vs. Legacy breeding software:* Modern cloud platform, genetics analysis (not just storage), professional client portal with payments and contracts, integrated marketplace discovery.
